How to use the Toggleable game features:

For Starters, scr_toggleablegameoptions is where you go to toggle custom features of Grape Engine On or Off:
Toggeling them all OFF will result in Original base Eggplant Build, while all of them ON will result in all of our
custom features that make Grape engine what it is.

How to enable Console and Debug mode

If you have global.debug mode set to True, then you can press F7 to enable rt shell console. Press F8 to enable Debug mode.
RT-Shell console already comes with Two commands (for now) which allow you to toggle on Collisions and Hitboxes!
Debug mode itself is just a bunch of important info that appears on your screen and can quickly toggle it on and off with F8.
However if you have global.debug mode set to False, none of the buttons mentioned above will do anything. Console and Debug mode will be turned off.
Set it to false whenever your mod is ready for release!

How do I use the custom tv palettes?

If you want to change the default tv frame palette, Look for the variable called tvframepaletteselect in obj_tv
If you want to change the player tv animation palettes then feel free to edit the peptv palette sprites.
Also palette select for the tv is tied to the obj_player palette so if you plan on altering the player palette, remember to alter the player TV palette aswell!
I also made a special dresser object for the tv frame palette switching. Search for obj_tvdresser and place it down to test it.
