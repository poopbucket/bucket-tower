Here are a list of things on what was changed as well as where to go for certain features.

As for navigation purposes, some objects mentioned in the readme were renamed. Well lots of things were renamed.
So here is what was renamed:
spr_player_poundcancel1 --> spr_player_groundpoundcancel1
spr_player_poundcancel2 --> spr_player_groundpoundcancel2
scr_player_backbreaker --> scr_player_tauntmoves
all tilesets were renamed to start with ts_ instead of tilesets_ or tileset_
spr_player_mach4 --> spr_player_mach3
spr_player_mach3 (the original sprite not the renamed one) --> spr_player_mach3OLD
spr_player_mach --> spr_player_mach1
spr_player_mach1(not the renamed one) --> spr_player_mach2
obj_donkey --> obj_cow
obj_hookup --> obj_flyingladder
obj_pepperpizza --> obj_jetpack
All the Ruin rooms were renamed so the room numbers would go in order as to how the ingame order of the rooms are


And that is all i can think of from the top of my head

The rest you should be able to navigate on your own, such as searching for sprites, placing down objects, all that jazz.
However if you did come from UTMT and just switched to GMS2 to use decomps, then I recommend looking up a tutorial on
how to get started with gms. However UTMT is pretty similar to GMS2, so im sure you will get the hang of it.
